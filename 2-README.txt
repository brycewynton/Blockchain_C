This is part C for the mini-projects that go into the final 
implementation of the Blockchain assignment,

In part A I made a simple block that can concatenate and hash its contents.

In part B, I made sure that my blockchain could marshall data out to JSON

For this part C, I am making sure that I can marshall JSON objects in and tuen them into
Java objects.
